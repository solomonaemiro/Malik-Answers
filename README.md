The classic Malik Answers app clone.
It supports both English and Amharic languages.
Download the release apk, check it out, and use it to mess (have fun) with your friends.
The secret is instead of writing Malik please answer, write dot first and then write the answer you want, the app will make it look like you are writing Malik please answer...
